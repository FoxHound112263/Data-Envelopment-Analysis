Data Envelopment Analysis for judicial efficiency in Colombia

This work consist in a proposal for the measurement of the efficiency of judicial circuits in Colombia. The paper can be found here: https://cienciashumanasyeconomicas.medellin.unal.edu.co/images/Revista-Intercambio/Numero3/4.EficienciaJudicial.pdf

## The model follows an efficiency frontier

## It must follow a convexity and a inefficiency condition

## Variable Returns to Scale was chosen according to hypothesis testing

## Algebraic topology helped to find two types of results according to the returns to scale

## The model produced this output (first circuits)

## With the results recommendations can be suggested in order to increase the efficiency of the non-efficient circuits
